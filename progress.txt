## Session - 2026-01-29

**Completed:**
- Fixed host statistics sorting bug (was alphabetical, now sorted by count)
- Optimized Jekyll performance with incremental builds
- Added Host filter dropdown to episodes page
- Added "Clear Filters" button to reset all filters
- Added live results counter ("Showing X of 455 episodes")
- Added Share button to episode detail pages (copy link to clipboard)
- All features from PRD Stories 4 & 5 implemented

**Files Changed:**
- website/_config.yml - Added incremental builds and Liquid optimizations
- website/_data/stats.yml - Regenerated with proper host sorting (Riki: 256, Adam: 49, etc.)
- website/scripts/csv_to_yaml.py - Fixed to use OrderedDict and preserve sort order
- website/stats.html - Removed broken sort_natural, now uses pre-sorted data
- website/episodes.html - Added host filter, results counter, clear button
- website/_layouts/episode.html - Added share button with clipboard functionality

**Decisions:**
- Pre-sort stats data in Python rather than Liquid (better performance)
- Use OrderedDict to preserve sort order when generating YAML
- Keep filtering client-side (no backend needed for 455 episodes)
- Share button uses native Clipboard API with fallback for older browsers

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Test site performance after incremental build changes
- [ ] Consider adding Grid/List view toggle (PRD Story 4)
- [ ] Consider adding Host tenure timeline visual (PRD Story 6)
- [ ] Engagement strategy: Reach out to Riki Rachtman with archive
  - Draft short message (Option 1 from discussion)
  - Lead with completed archive value
  - No ask, just share the work

**Gotchas:**
- Jekyll's sort_natural filter doesn't work on hash values by count
- PyYAML outputs Python objects when using OrderedDict - need to convert to dict before dumping
- Host filtering required adding data-host attribute to episode cards
- 455 episode files load slowly without incremental builds enabled

**Project Status:**
- MVP website: ✅ Complete
- V2 Design: ✅ Applied and looks good
- Host stats: ✅ Fixed and working
- Core PRD features: ✅ Mostly complete
- Missing: Grid/list toggle, host timeline visual (nice-to-haves)

**Riki Rachtman Outreach Context:**
- He sells merch on cathousehollywood.com (needs upgrade)
- User wants old show archives from his era (1990-1995)
- Strategy: Lead with value (show him the archive), don't ask for anything initially
- Short message approach recommended: "Built archive of all 455 episodes, your era documented, check it out: [link]"
