Core Aesthetic Keywords (the one-sentence version you can lead with):
“Late-80s/early-90s MTV heavy-metal television branding: high-contrast chrome/beveled metallic lettering with aggressive blackletter/gothic spikes, extreme 3D extrusion and drop-shadows, saturated magenta-to-black gradient backgrounds, and a raw, airbrushed analog-video glow.”
Detailed Style Guide Breakdown

Typography
Heavily customized blackletter/gothic base (think Fraktur/Old English but aggressively metal-ized).
Extreme sharpening and outward-pointing spikes/fleurs-de-lis on almost every terminal and crossbar (especially visible on the H, B, and S).
Very tall, condensed proportions with razor-thin waists and exaggerated thick/thin contrast.
All letters interconnected with sharp, thorn-like serifs that almost look weaponized.

3D/Chroming & Bevel
Pronounced 45-degree beveling with bright white/chromium highlights on the upper-left edges.
Deep black drop-shadows on the lower-right (classic 80s/90s Photoshop “outer glow + drop shadow” look, but pre-digital—originally airbrushed).
Metallic gradient fill: bright gold/yellow at the center fading to a cooler silver on the edges, then hard black outlines.
Slight inner glow in electric magenta/pink to make it pop off dark backgrounds.

Color Palette
Primary: Rich black (#000000)
Secondary: Saturated magenta/red-purple video gradient (typical CRT/analog video bleed)
Accents: Bright chrome white (#ffffff – #d0d0d0), metallic gold (#ffd700 → #b39700 gradient)
Overall vibe: High saturation, high contrast, looks like it’s glowing on a 1989 television screen.

Background & Texture
Deep black-to-magenta radial or linear gradients.
Subtle analog video noise/grain.
Occasional lightning bolts, skulls, or guitar necks layered behind (in the original bumpers).
Everything feels slightly oversaturated and “hot,” like it was shot on tape and pushed in post.

Overall Mood & References
Pure 1989–1994 MTV metal programming energy: dangerous, rebellious, unapologetically cheesy yet badass.
Visual siblings: classic Metallica “…And Justice for All” album bevels, early Megadeth wordmarks, MTV’s own 80s–90s motion graphics packages, old WrestleMania logos, monster-truck rally graphics, airbrushed van art.


One-Paragraph Version You Can Copy-Paste to a Designer
“We want the exact late-80s/early-90s MTV Headbangers Ball treatment: hyper-aggressive blackletter/gothic lettering with razor-sharp spikes and fleurs-de-lis exploding off every terminal, heavy chrome bevel and 3D extrusion with white upper-left highlights and deep black lower-right drop shadows, metallic gold-to-silver gradient fills outlined in black, set against a saturated magenta-to-black gradient backdrop with subtle video noise and analog glow. Think pre-digital airbrushed metal logo that looks like it’s burned into a 1989 CRT screen—maximum over-the-top thrash-metal television cheese, but executed perfectly.”
That description will get you 95% of the way there with any competent metal-savvy designer.
